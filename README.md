# Fuzzy Name-matching

Name matching algorithm for company to CRSP permnos (US. public firms)

Please use matcher.py as it reflects a new wave of disambiguation efforts. 

To help with this project, add name pair that should be matched to the white list and bad matches in the black list. I will periodically look at those problematic ones and further improve this algo
